    <h2>What Inspired Us</h2>
    <p>We were inspired by the devastating impact of water crises during floods, where access to clean drinking water becomes a luxury for many. We saw how families were forced to rely on contaminated water sources, leading to the spread of waterborne diseases and further exacerbating the crisis.

        We were particularly moved by the stories of communities in flood-prone areas, where the lack of access to clean water was not only a matter of convenience but a matter of life and death. We realized that the existing solutions were often inadequate, expensive, or inaccessible to those who needed them most.
        
        This is why we created Jal, Mitra - a innovative solution that harnesses the power of technology to provide clean drinking water during floods. Our goal is to ensure that no one has to suffer from water scarcity during times of crisis, and that everyone has access to this basic human right.</p>
